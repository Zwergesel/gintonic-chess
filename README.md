# Gintonic Chess

Gintonic Chess is a chess engine created by Alexander Wirth as a hobby project during 2008.
The engine was originally written in Java; now it is being ported to C++ in order to gain
better performance and to have a fresh start in order to clean up and refactor the core engine.

The engine was never meant to compete at a high level and is weak in comparison to most popular
engines.
